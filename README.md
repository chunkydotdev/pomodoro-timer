## The Basic Pomodoro Process:
1. **Choose a Task:** Decide on the task or project you want to work on.

2. **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes:** This 25-minute work interval is called a "Pomodoro." During this time, focus entirely on the task, avoiding all distractions.

3. **Take a Break:** Once the timer goes off, take a short 5-minute break. Stand up, stretch, grab a drink, or do something relaxing.

4. **Repeat the Process:** After your break, reset the timer and start another Pomodoro (25-minute work interval). After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes) to recharge.

## The Pomodoro Technique in Detail:
- **Pomodoro Timer:** The timer is the core of the Pomodoro Technique. It helps you focus on a task for a set period, followed by a short break.

- **Pomodoro Cycle:** A Pomodoro cycle consists of a 25-minute work interval (Pomodoro), followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

- **Task Management:** The Pomodoro Technique helps you break down tasks into manageable intervals. This makes it easier to focus on one task at a time and avoid multitasking.

- **Time Tracking:** By tracking your Pomodoros, you can measure your productivity and identify patterns in your work habits. This helps you optimize your workflow and improve time management.


## 5-Minute Short Breaks:
These help your brain reset and prevent burnout. The short break should involve something light or relaxing.

## Long Break (15-30 Minutes):
After completing four Pomodoros, a longer break helps you rest before another cycle of focused work.
